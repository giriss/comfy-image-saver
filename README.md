## Customization of file/folder names

You can use following placeholders:

- `%date`
- `%seed`
- `%counter`
- `%sampler_name`
- `%steps`
- `%cfg`
- `%scheduler`
- `%time` *â€“ format taken from `time_format`*
- `%model` *â€“ full name of model file*
- `%basemodelname` *â€“ name of model (without file extension)*

Example:

| `filename` value | Result file name |
| --- | --- |
| `%time-%basemodelname-%cfg-%steps-%sampler_name-%scheduler-%seed` | `2023-11-16-131331-Anything-v4.5-pruned-mergedVae-7.0-25-dpm_2-normal-1_01.png` |
